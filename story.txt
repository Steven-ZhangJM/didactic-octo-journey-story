One day, a student called J died in cs course.
After one minute, he back to life and smile to his classmates.

His death, though ultimately inconsquential, was concerning. What caused him to die?
How could he be alive again? Questions swirled.

Was he just asleep? What was the cause of death? Some point to a possible death because of boredom.
But critics not the awesomeness of the amazing Deb Deppler, and how would it be possible to be bored
in her class?

A new theory arose. J's death was predicted the be the cause of a sneaky student in the back row. This student 
had snuck a poison into J's water before he had taken a sip mid lecture. Little did he know at the time, this sip
would be his last as he sunk into a deep, dark sleep.
